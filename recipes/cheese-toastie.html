        <p>A grilled cheese (sometimes known as a toasted sandwich or cheese toastie)
             is a hot cheese sandwich typically prepared by heating slices of cheese between
              slices of bread with a cooking fat such as butter or mayonnaise on a frying pan
              , griddle, or sandwich toaster, until the bread browns and the cheese melts.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon salted butter</li>
            <li>4 slices good-quality bread</li>
            <li>2 ounces cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Butter one side of each slice of bread. We don't recommend buttering both
                 sides of the bread for a cheese toastie since it can make the sandwich a bit soggy.</li>
            <li>Grate the cheddar cheese using a large hole grater (if you use a small hole the cheese will melt too quickly before the bread has toasted).
                 Divide the cheese between 2 slices of bread, placing it on the unbuttered side.</li>
            <li>Season with a bit of salt and pepper to taste. </li>
            <li>Cover with the second slice of bread, buttered-side up. </li>
            <li>Heat your griddle or frying pan to hot but not smoking. Using a flat spatula, lay the 2 sandwiches into the hot pan (they should sizzle a little as they hit the panâ€”if not, the pan is not hot enough). Gently press the sandwich with the spatula and do not worry if the cheese leaks a little. Cook for a few minutes
                 on one side pressing from time to time, then flip it over and repeat on the other side. </li>
            <li>Remove from the pan once the cheese is starting to melt
                 and the bread has turned a golden brown. </li>
            <li>Cut diagonally in half and serve immediately piping hot. </li>

        </ol>
